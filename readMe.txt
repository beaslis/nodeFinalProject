# Node.js User and Card Management API

## Project Overview
This Node.js project provides an API for managing users and business cards. The application starts with three initial users
and three initial cards. It includes authentication, authorization, and admin functionalities.
Additionally, the project implements three bonus features: 
an admin can change a business number, a file logger records errors 
and users are blocked for 24hurs after 3 failed login attempts .

## for put requests in postman:
When updating a nested object (e.g., name), you must send the entire object, not just the changed field.
(make sure if there are any required faileds)

## Bonus Features
1. **Admin Business Number Change**: Admins can change a business number, provided it is not already assigned to another business.
2. **File Logger**: A logging system records all requests with a status code of 400 or higher. It saves logs in a `logs` directory,
with filenames corresponding to the request date.
3. **User Lockout**: A user attempting to log in with an incorrect password three times consecutively is locked out for 24 hours.
